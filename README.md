# RoadToMSc
**The Road So Far**

## Intorduction
I am MSc student of the Amirkabir University of Technology.
My research interest is NFV and my thesis about placing and routing SFC requests with management constraints.
By management constraints, we mean providing VNFM for each SFC.
Problem formulation implemented in [IBM Cplex](https://www.ibm.com/analytics/cplex-optimizer) and can be accessed in the
`simulation` folder.  For running simulation, you need Cplex installed on your system after you have Cplex installed you can
run the simulation with following java option:

```
"-Djava.library.path=$USER_HOME$/Application/CPLEX_Studio-Community128/cplex/bin/x86-64_linux"
```
