# RoadToMSc
**The Road So Far**

## Intorduction
I am MSc student of the Amirkabir University of Technology.
My research interest is NFV and my thesis about placing and routing SFC requests with management constraints.
By management constraints, we mean providing VNFM for each SFC.

## Step by Step from Proposal
When you enter MSc of the Amirkabir University of Technology you must first write a proposal
for your problem and ideas that you have to solve it and present it in professors community.
for this steps see [presentation](presentation/main.pdf) and [proposal](proposal/AUTthesis.pdf).
After the proposal, you are free to do whatever you want with your project until next semester. In the next
semester you must present your idea again for new students and after that, you pass the seminar
course :tada:. At the end, you must complete your thesis and solution to your proposed problem.
I wish you a nice thesis :muscle:.

## Special Thanks
I want to thank Behrooz Farkiani who help me so much in this dark way.
